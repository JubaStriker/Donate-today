                <p>How many flood shelters are in Bangladesh?
                    2,000 designated shelters
                    The notion of “shelter” in Bangladesh prompts “cyclone shelter” to come to mind. At present, around
                    2,000 designated shelters are distributed all over the coastal districts, where people take refuge
                    during cyclones. But these are not enough. More shelters needed to minimize the death number. Strong
                    disaster centers are cruicial for children and elderly people. </p>

                    schooling does not lead to learning. Specially in cirsis like flood it becomes impossible for
